 
 ARCS - an interactive generator base on georg nees "kreisboegen"
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 this is a small generator to modify the output of a simple algorithm which should replicate "Kreisboegen" by Georg Nees.
 we've build this with processing and the G4P Library for the GUI.
 
 our goal is to make it more interactiv, intuitiv and beautiful.
 we're thinking about changing the UI, maybe add music which will interact with it in a way. we're always thinking about 
 new ideas aswell.
